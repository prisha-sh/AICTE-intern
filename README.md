Human Pose Estimation Using Machine Learning
This project focuses on creating an efficient system for human pose estimation using machine learning techniques. It detects body keypoints from images or video frames and reconstructs human poses for applications like fitness tracking, augmented reality, human-computer interaction, and sports analytics.

Features
Input Module: Accepts images or videos from cameras or uploaded files and preprocesses them for analysis.
Feature Extraction: Uses convolutional neural networks (CNNs) like ResNet or MobileNet to extract meaningful features from input data.
Pose Detection Module: Generates heatmaps for body keypoints (e.g., joints) and Part Affinity Fields (PAFs) to link these keypoints into a coherent skeleton.
Post-Processing: Refines detected poses using Non-Maximum Suppression (NMS) and outputs the human pose as connected keypoints.
Output Module: Visualizes the detected human poses overlaid on the original input and provides keypoint coordinates with confidence scores.
Technology Stack
Programming Language: Python
Frameworks: TensorFlow, PyTorch, or OpenCV
Models: Pretrained models like ResNet or MobileNet
Tools: NumPy, Matplotlib for data processing and visualization
Applications
Fitness and health monitoring
Augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR)
Human-computer interaction
Sports performance analysis
Future Scope
Expanding the model to detect poses in complex scenarios, such as group interactions or crowded environments
Enhancing real-time processing speed for seamless integration into live applications
Incorporating IoT-based monitoring systems to extend usability
